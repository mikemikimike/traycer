 * Where the app's own chrome sits and how much of it shows.
 *
 * The page is the full-width host for the SAME section tree the inspector
 * docks (L-03), so this collection describes only what search has to land on:
 * the page, the presets block, one anchor per surface group, and the one row
 * that belongs to a surface rather than to a region (L-51).
 *
 * The regions themselves are not listed here. They come from
 * `lib/layout/layout-search.definitions.ts`, generated from the region
 * registry, because the registry is already the one description of a region's
 * name and its keywords and a second copy here could only drift from it.
